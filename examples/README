The files in this directory are sample PMIx applications provided both
as a trivial primer to PMIx as well as simple tests to ensure that your
PMIx Reference Server installation is working properly.


There are two MPI examples in this directory, each using one of six
different MPI interfaces:

- Hello world
  C:                   hello_c.c
  C++:                 hello_cxx.cc
  Fortran mpif.h:      hello_mpifh.f
  Fortran use mpi:     hello_usempi.f90
  Fortran use mpi_f08: hello_usempif08.f90
  Java:                Hello.java
  C shmem.h:           hello_oshmem_c.c
  Fortran shmem.fh:    hello_oshmemfh.f90

- Send a trivial message around in a ring
  C:                   ring_c.c
  C++:                 ring_cxx.cc
  Fortran mpif.h:      ring_mpifh.f
  Fortran use mpi:     ring_usempi.f90
  Fortran use mpi_f08: ring_usempif08.f90
  Java:                Ring.java
  C shmem.h:           ring_oshmem_c.c
  Fortran shmem.fh:    ring_oshmemfh.f90

The Makefile assumes that the wrapper compilers mpicc, mpic++, and
mpifort are in your path.

Make today a PMIx day!
