# This is the VERSION file for Open MPI, describing the precise
# version of Open MPI in this distribution.  The various components of
# the version number below are combined to form a single version
# number string.

# major, minor, and release are generally combined in the form
# <major>.<minor>.<release>.

major=1
minor=0
release=0

# greek is generally used for alpha or beta release tags.  If it is
# non-empty, it will be appended to the version number.  It does not
# have to be numeric.  Common examples include: a1 (alpha release 1),
# b1 (beta release 1), rc2 (release candidate 2).  The only
# requirement is that it must be entirely printable ASCII characters
# and have no white space.

greek=rc1

# If repo_rev is empty, then the repository version number will be
# obtained during "make dist" via the "git describe --tags --always"
# command, or with the date (if "git describe" fails) in the form of
# "date<date>".

repo_rev=

# If tarball_version is not empty, it is used as the version string in
# the tarball filename, regardless of all other versions listed in
# this file.  For example, if tarball_version is empty, the tarball
# filename will be of the form
# openmpi-<major>.<minor>.<release><greek>.tar.*.  However, if
# tarball_version is not empty, the tarball filename will be of the
# form openmpi-<tarball_version>.tar.*.

tarball_version=gitclone

# The date when this release was created

date="Nov 24, 2018"

# The shared library version of each of PRRTE's public libraries.
# These versions are maintained in accordance with the "Library
# Interface Versions" chapter from the GNU Libtool documentation:
#
# - If the library source code has changed at all since the last
#   update, then increment revision (`c:r:a' becomes `c:r+1:a').
#
# - If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since
#   the last update, increment current, and set revision to 0.
#
# - If any interfaces have been added since the last public release,
#   then increment age.
#
# - If any interfaces have been removed since the last public release,
#   then set age to 0.
#
# All changes in these version numbers are dictated by the PRRTE
# release managers (not individual developers). Since these version
# numbers are associated with *releases*, the # version numbers
# maintained on the PRRTE Github trunk (and developer # branches)
# is always 0:0:0 for all libraries.

# Version numbers are described in the Libtool current:revision:age
# format.

# NOTE: The ORTE and OPAL code in this package don't cleanly correlate
# to any release point in the OMPI code base as the two codes (PRRTE
# and OMPI) forked at some arbitrary point in time, and each has been
# updated independently of each other. Since the libraries produced
# by this package are explicitly prefixed with its name, there is
# no issue of library confusion between the two packages. Thus, we
# restart the PRRTE libraries at 1:0:0.
#
# At some future time, it is possible that the OMPI and PRRTE codes
# will "re-converge" - there are open discussions of OMPI replacing
# its copy of ORTE with PRRTE. Should that happen, it is expected
# that the OPAL code in this package would be removed and replaced
# with a Git submodule. This would result in major change in the
# OPAL version number linked against PRRTE. Rather than trying to
# anticipate that change, starting the numbering back at 1:0:0
# guarantees that the revised OPAL version will be a step upward
# to a higher number, thus ensuring that the linker does the
# right thing

libprteopen_rte_so_version=1:0:0
libprteopen_pal_so_version=1:0:0

# "Common" components install standalone libraries that are run-time
# linked by one or more components.  So they need to be versioned as
# well.  Yuck; this somewhat breaks the
# components-don't-affect-the-build-system abstraction.
